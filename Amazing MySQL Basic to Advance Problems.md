```
- **What is the difference between an `INNER JOIN` and a `LEFT JOIN`?**
   - **Answer:** An `INNER JOIN` returns rows when there is a match in both tables, while a `LEFT JOIN` returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If there's no match, the result is `NULL` on the right side.
- **What is normalization, and why is it important?**
   - **Answer:** Normalization is the process of organizing a database to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity. It divides larger tables into smaller ones and establishes relationships between them using foreign keys.
- **Describe 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF in database normalization.**
   - **Answer:**
      - **1NF (First Normal Form):** Each table has a primary key, and all attributes are atomic (no repeating groups or arrays).
      - **2NF (Second Normal Form):** All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
      - **3NF (Third Normal Form):** All attributes are functionally dependent only on the primary key.
   - **What is a subquery, and how is it different from a JOIN?**
   - **Answer:** A subquery is a query nested inside another query. A subquery can return data that will be used in the main query as a condition. A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
- **Write a query to find employees whose salary is above the average salary.**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);

```
```
Output
+---------------+--------+
| employee_name | salary |
+---------------+--------+
| ALLEN         |   1600 |
| WARD          |   1250 |
| JONES         |   2975 |
+---------------+--------+

```
- **What is a stored procedure in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** A stored procedure is a precompiled group of SQL statements stored in the database. It can be invoked as needed.
Let's assume we have a table named 'products' with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Laptop', 800);
INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Smartphone', 600);
INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Headphones', 150);
INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Tablet', 300);
INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Smartwatch', 200);

```
Now, let's create a stored procedure named 'GetExpensiveProducts' that retrieves products with prices higher than a specified threshold:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE GetExpensiveProducts (IN minPrice DECIMAL(10, 2))
BEGIN
    SELECT id, name, price
    FROM products
    WHERE price > minPrice;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

In this example:

The DELIMITER statement is used to change the delimiter from ; to // temporarily to allow the definition of the stored procedure with multiple SQL statements.
The CREATE PROCEDURE statement defines the name of the procedure (GetExpensiveProducts) and specifies an input parameter (minPrice of type DECIMAL(10, 2)).
The BEGIN and END keywords mark the beginning and end of the procedure body, respectively.
Within the procedure body, a SELECT statement is used to retrieve products with prices higher than the specified minPrice.
After creating the stored procedure, you can call it to retrieve expensive products:

```sql
CALL GetExpensiveProducts(150);
```
```sql
Output
The output of calling the 'GetExpensiveProducts' stored procedure with a minimum price of '150' 
would be a result set containing the id, name, and price columns of the 'products' 
from the 'products' table where the "price" is greater than '150'.
+----+------------+-------+
| id | name       | price |
+----+------------+-------+
|  1 | Laptop     | 800.00|
|  2 | Smartphone | 600.00|
|  4 | Tablet     | 300.00|
|  5 | Smartwatch | 200.00|
+----+------------+-------+
```

- **How can you handle errors in stored procedures?**
   - **Answer:** In MySQL, you can use the `DECLARE` statement to define error handlers using `CONTINUE` or `EXIT` handlers.
- **How do you prevent SQL injection in your queries?**
   - **Answer:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements, avoid constructing queries with string concatenation using external input, and always validate and sanitize user input.
- **What are `TRIGGERS` in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** Triggers are automatic actions that the database can perform when a specified change occurs (like an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation).
```sql
Let's say we have a simple database with two tables: `employees` and `audit_log`. We want to create a trigger that automatically logs any changes made to the `employees` table into the `audit_log` table. We'll create an `AFTER UPDATE` trigger for this purpose.

First, let's create the tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    action VARCHAR(100),
    employee_id INT,
    old_salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    new_salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Now, let's create the trigger:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_update
AFTER UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_log (action, employee_id, old_salary, new_salary)
    VALUES ('Employee Updated', OLD.id, OLD.salary, NEW.salary);
END;
//

DELIMITER ;
```

In this trigger:

- `after_employee_update`: This is the name of the trigger.
- `AFTER UPDATE ON employees`: This specifies that the trigger should be fired after an update operation on the `employees` table.
- `FOR EACH ROW`: Indicates that the trigger should be executed for each row that is affected by the update operation.
- `BEGIN...END`: This is the body of the trigger, which contains the SQL statements to be executed when the trigger is fired.
- `OLD.id`, `OLD.salary`, `NEW.salary`: These refer to the values of the `id` and `salary` columns before and after the update operation, respectively.

Now, whenever an update is made to the `employees` table, the trigger will automatically insert a record into the `audit_log` table, capturing the action (`Employee Updated`), the `employee_id`, the old salary (`old_salary`), and the new salary (`new_salary`).

For example, if we update an employee's salary:

```sql
UPDATE employees SET salary = 50000 WHERE id = 1;
```

This will trigger the `after_employee_update` trigger, 
and a record will be inserted into the `audit_log` table with details about the update.

```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_log;
```

Output:
```
+----+------------------+-------------+------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | action           | employee_id | old_salary | new_salary | timestamp           |
|----|------------------|-------------|------------|------------|---------------------|
| 1  | Employee Updated | 1           | 45000.00   | 50000.00   | 2024-04-25 12:00:00 |
+----+------------------+-------------+------------+------------+---------------------+
``` 
```
This record in the `audit_log` table captures the details of the update operation, including the employee ID, 
the old salary, and the new salary, along with a timestamp indicating when the update occurred.
```

- **Can you explain the difference between `CHAR_LENGTH` and `LENGTH` functions?**
   - **Answer:** `CHAR_LENGTH` returns the number of characters in a string, while `LENGTH` returns the number of bytes. For single-byte character sets, they return the same value.

Let's explain the difference between `CHAR_LENGTH` and `LENGTH` functions in MySQL with an example.

Suppose we have a string that contains characters from a single-byte character set (such as Latin1 or ASCII). 
In this case, both `CHAR_LENGTH` and `LENGTH` will return the same value because each character occupies one byte.

Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT CHAR_LENGTH('Hello') AS char_length,
       LENGTH('Hello') AS length;
```

Output:
```
| char_length | length |
|-------------|--------|
| 5           | 5      |
```

In the above query:
- `CHAR_LENGTH('Hello')` returns the number of characters in the string `'Hello'`, which is 5.
- `LENGTH('Hello')` returns the number of bytes in the string `'Hello'`, which is also 5 because each character in this string occupies one byte in a single-byte character set.

Now, let's consider a string that contains characters from a multi-byte character set (such as UTF-8), 
where characters can occupy more than one byte.

```sql
SELECT CHAR_LENGTH('😊') AS char_length,
       LENGTH('😊') AS length;
```

Output:
```
| char_length | length |
|-------------|--------|
| 1           | 4      |
```

In this example, `'😊'` is a single emoji character. However, in UTF-8 encoding, emojis can require multiple bytes to represent. Here's the difference:
- `CHAR_LENGTH('😊')` returns 1 because it counts the number of characters in the string, and there's only one character (the emoji).
- `LENGTH('😊')` returns 4 because the emoji `'😊'` is represented by 4 bytes in UTF-8 encoding.

So, the key difference between `CHAR_LENGTH` and `LENGTH` is how they count characters and bytes respectively, especially when dealing with multi-byte character sets. `CHAR_LENGTH` counts characters, while `LENGTH` counts bytes.


- **What is the purpose of the `GROUP_CONCAT` function in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** `GROUP_CONCAT` returns a concatenated string of aggregated data values for each group of rows in the result set.
Absolutely! The `GROUP_CONCAT` function in MySQL is incredibly useful for aggregating data into a single string within each group of rows in
the result set. It's commonly used when you want to concatenate values from multiple rows into a single string, typically when working with 
grouped data.

Here's a bit more detail on how it works with an example:

Suppose you have a table named `orders` with the following structure:

| order_id | customer_id | product_name |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| 1        | 101         | Laptop       |
| 2        | 101         | Smartphone   |
| 3        | 102         | Tablet       |
| 4        | 103         | Headphones   |
| 5        | 102         | Smartwatch   |

Now, if you want to get a concatenated list of product names for each customer, you can use `GROUP_CONCAT`:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, GROUP_CONCAT(product_name) AS purchased_products
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

This query will produce the following result:

| customer_id | purchased_products         |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| 101         | Laptop,Smartphone          |
| 102         | Tablet,Smartwatch          |
| 103         | Headphones                 |

In this example:
- We're grouping the rows by the `customer_id`.
- `GROUP_CONCAT(product_name)` concatenates all the `product_name` values for each group (customer) into a single comma-separated string.
- The result shows each `customer_id` along with the concatenated list of `product_name` for that customer.

This function is handy for generating reports, displaying aggregated data, or creating comma-separated lists of values within groups.

- **Write a SQL query to concatenate all names from the `employees` table into a single string, separated by commas.**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(employee_name) FROM employees;

```
```sql
Output
+-------------------------------------+
| concatenated_names                  |
+-------------------------------------+
| Alice,Bob,Charlie,David,Eva         |

- **How can you create an index in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name(column_name);

```
Sure, let's create an index on a table in MySQL with an example.

Suppose we have a table named `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, `department`, and `salary`, and we want to create an index on the `department` column to optimize queries that filter or sort by department.

Here's how you would create an index on the `department` column:

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_department ON employees(department);
```

After executing this SQL statement, MySQL will create an index named `index_department` on the `department` column of the `employees` table.

To verify that the index has been created, you can use the `SHOW INDEX` command:

```sql
SHOW INDEX FROM employees;
```

This command will display information about all indexes on the `employees` table, including the newly created `index_department`.

Here's an example of the output:

```
+------------+------------+------------------+--------------+-------------+-----------+-------------+----------+--------+------+------------+---------+---------------+
| Table      | Non_unique | Key_name         | Seq_in_index | Column_name | Collation | Cardinality | Sub_part | Packed | Null | Index_type | Comment | Index_comment |
+------------+------------+------------------+--------------+-------------+-----------+-------------+----------+--------+------+------------+---------+---------------+
| employees  |          1 | index_department|            1 | department  | A         |           4 |     NULL | NULL   | YES  | BTREE      |         |               |
+------------+------------+------------------+--------------+-------------+-----------+-------------+----------+--------+------+------------+---------+---------------+
```

In the output, you'll see the `Key_name` column containing the name of the index (`index_department`), and the `Column_name` column showing the indexed column (`department`). This confirms that the index has been successfully created on the `department` column of the `employees` table.
- **What is the difference between a clustered and a non-clustered index?**
   - **Answer:** A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table. A table can have only one clustered index. Non-clustered indexes, on the other hand, do not determine the physical order and a table can have multiple non-clustered indexes.

- **What are views in MySQL, and why are they used?**
   - **Answer:** A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. They allow encapsulating complex queries, providing a simplified representation or hiding certain data.

```Example```
```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name) VALUES
(1, 'Engineering'),
(2, 'Sales'),
(3, 'Marketing');

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, salary, department_id) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 50000.00, 1),
(2, 'Bob', 60000.00, 2),
(3, 'Charlie', 55000.00, 1),
(4, 'David', 58000.00, 3),
(5, 'Eva', 52000.00, 2);
```

Now, let's create a view `employee_details` that combines data from the `employees` and `departments` tables:

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_details AS
SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name, e.salary, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

This view selects columns from both tables and joins them based on the `department_id` to provide a view of employee details along with their department names.

Now, if we query the `employee_details` view, we'll get a simplified representation of employee information:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee_details;
```

Output:
```
| employee_id | employee_name | salary   | department_name |
|-------------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1           | Alice         | 50000.00 | Engineering     |
| 2           | Bob           | 60000.00 | Sales           |
| 3           | Charlie       | 55000.00 | Engineering     |
| 4           | David         | 58000.00 | Marketing       |
| 5           | Eva           | 52000.00 | Sales           |
```

```
In this output, we see a simplified view of employee details, including their names, salaries, and department names, 
provided by the 'employee_details' view. 
This allows users to query the data without needing to understand the underlying structure of the `employees` 
and `departments` tables.
```

- **What are transactions in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** Transactions are a sequence of one or more SQL operations executed as a single unit. They ensure data integrity, following the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

- **How do you start and commit a transaction in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
-- SQL operations
COMMIT;

```

Let's illustrate transactions in MySQL with an example involving a banking scenario. 
We'll simulate a scenario where a transfer of funds between two accounts needs to be performed within a transaction to ensure data integrity.

Suppose we have a table named `accounts` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    account_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    account_name VARCHAR(100),
    balance DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

And let's insert some sample data into the `accounts` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO accounts (account_id, account_name, balance) VALUES
(1, 'John', 1000.00),
(2, 'Alice', 2000.00);
```

Now, let's perform a fund transfer from account 1 (John) to account 2 (Alice) within a transaction:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500.00 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500.00 WHERE account_id = 2;

COMMIT;
```

In this example:

- We start a transaction with the `START TRANSACTION` statement, indicating the beginning of a transaction.
- We then execute two `UPDATE` statements within the transaction to subtract $500 from John's account (account_id = 1) and add $500 to Alice's account (account_id = 2).
- Finally, we commit the transaction with the `COMMIT` statement, indicating that all the changes made within the transaction should be applied to the database.

If the transaction is successful and no errors occur during its execution, the changes made by the transaction will be committed, 
and the database will be updated accordingly.

After committing the transaction, if we query the `accounts` table, we'll see the updated balances:

```sql
SELECT * FROM accounts;
```

Output:
```
| account_id | account_name | balance   |
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1          | John         | 500.00    |
| 2          | Alice        | 2500.00   |

```

In this output, we can see that $500 has been transferred from John's account to Alice's account, and the balances have been updated accordingly. This demonstrates the successful execution of the transaction. If any error had occurred during the transaction, we could have rolled back the changes using the `ROLLBACK` statement to ensure data consistency.


- **What is the difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`?**
   - **Answer:** `UNION` returns unique records from the combined dataset, while `UNION ALL` returns all records, including duplicates.

Let's say we have two tables, `table1` and `table2`, with the following data:

```
table1
+----+--------+
| ID | Value  |
+----+--------+
| 1  | Apple  |
| 2  | Banana |
| 3  | Orange |
+----+--------+

table2
+----+--------+
| ID | Value  |
+----+--------+
| 3  | Orange |
| 4  | Mango  |
| 5  | Apple  |
+----+--------+
```

If we use `UNION`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
UNION
SELECT * FROM table2;
```

The result would be:

```
+----+--------+
| ID | Value  |
+----+--------+
| 1  | Apple  |
| 2  | Banana |
| 3  | Orange |
| 4  | Mango  |
| 5  | Apple  |
+----+--------+
```

As you can see, `UNION` removes duplicates. In this case, the duplicate record with ID 3 (Orange) is removed.

If we use `UNION ALL`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM table2;
```

The result would be:

```
+----+--------+
| ID | Value  |
+----+--------+
| 1  | Apple  |
| 2  | Banana |
| 3  | Orange |
| 3  | Orange |
| 4  | Mango  |
| 5  | Apple  |
+----+--------+
```

With `UNION ALL`, all records from both tables are returned, including duplicates. That's the main difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`.

- **What are the advantages of using stored procedures?**
   - **Answer:** They provide better performance as they are precompiled, help in modular programming, offer a security mechanism, and reduce network traffic.

Example:
Suppose we have a stored procedure named `GetEmployeeDetails` that retrieves employee details based on the employee ID. Here's a simple example:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails
    @EmployeeID INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = @EmployeeID;
END;
```

Solution:
Let's say we want to retrieve details for employee with ID 101. We can execute the stored procedure like this:

```sql
EXEC GetEmployeeDetails @EmployeeID = 101;
```

This will return the details of the employee with ID 101 without exposing the underlying table structure or implementation details.

- **What is the difference between `DATEDIFF` and `TIMESTAMPDIFF` in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** Both are used to find the difference between two dates, but `TIMESTAMPDIFF` allows for a more specific interval, like month or year, while `DATEDIFF` returns the difference in days.

1. **DATEDIFF:**
   - `DATEDIFF` function calculates the difference between two dates in terms of days.
   - It takes two date expressions as arguments and returns the difference in days.

Example:
Suppose we have two dates, `start_date` and `end_date`, and we want to find the difference between them in days.

```sql
SELECT DATEDIFF('2024-05-05', '2024-04-01') AS DayDifference;
```

This will return `34`, indicating that there are 34 days between May 5, 2024, and April 1, 2024.

2. **TIMESTAMPDIFF:**
   - `TIMESTAMPDIFF` function calculates the difference between two datetime or timestamp expressions.
   - It allows for more specific intervals such as years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, etc.

Example:
Suppose we want to find the difference between two datetime values, `start_datetime` and `end_datetime`, in terms of months.

```sql
SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(MONTH, '2024-01-01', '2024-05-01') AS MonthDifference;
```


- **How do you clone a table in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** To clone a table in MySQL, you can use the CREATE TABLE statement along with a SELECT statement to copy the data from 
   the original table into the new table.
```sql
CREATE TABLE NEW_EMP AS SELECT * FROM EMP;

```
- **Write a SQL query to rank employees based on their salary in descending order.**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) AS ranking 
FROM employees;

```
- **How do you remove duplicate rows in a table?**
   - **Answer:** One common way is to create a new table with the distinct rows and delete the original table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT DISTINCT * FROM original_table;
DROP TABLE original_table;
RENAME TABLE new_table TO original_table;

```
- **What are the default storage engines in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** The default storage engine was MyISAM up to MySQL 5.5, but InnoDB became the default from MySQL 5.5 onward.
- **What is a self-join, and why would you use it?**
   - **Answer:** A self-join is a join of a table to itself.
Here's an example of a self-join query:
```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.EmployeeName, m.EmployeeName AS ManagerName
FROM Employees e
JOIN Employees m ON e.ManagerID = m.EmployeeID;
```

- **What is the purpose of the `SET` data type in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** The `SET` type is used to store a set of strings. You can store zero or more string values chosen from a list defined at table creation time.
```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (colors SET('red', 'blue', 'green'));
INSERT INTO t1 (colors) VALUES ('red,blue');

```s
- **How do you implement pagination in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** Using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`.
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;  -- Skips the first 20 records and fetches the next 10.

```
- **How can you retrieve the month part from a `DATE` field in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** Using the `MONTH()` function.
```sql
SELECT MONTH(date_column) FROM table_name;

```
- **How do you convert a `DATETIME` field into a Unix timestamp?**
   - **Answer:** Using the `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()` function.
```sql
SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP(datetime_column) FROM table_name;

```
- **How can you perform a case-sensitive search in a column?**
   - **Answer:** Using the `BINARY` keyword.
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE BINARY column_name = 'Value';

```
- **How can you transpose rows into columns, and vice versa, in a query result?**
   - **Answer:** This process is known as "Pivoting". To convert rows to columns, you use a combination of aggregate functions with `CASE` statements. For the reverse, known as "Unpivoting", you can use `UNION ALL`.
```sql
-- Pivoting:
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN column = 'value1' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS 'Value1',
    SUM(CASE WHEN column = 'value2' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS 'Value2'
FROM table_name;

-- Unpivoting:
SELECT 'Value1' AS 'Column', Value1 AS 'Value' FROM table_name
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Value2' AS 'Column', Value2 AS 'Value' FROM table_name;

```
- **How can you get a list of all indexes in a database?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
SHOW INDEXES FROM table_name IN database_name;

```
- **How can you optimize a MySQL query?**
   - **Answer:** Some methods include using `EXPLAIN` to analyze the query plan, indexing appropriate columns, avoiding the use of wildcard characters at the start of a `LIKE` query, and avoiding the use of `SELECT *`.
- **What is the difference between `MyISAM` and `InnoDB`?**
   - **Answer:** Major differences include:
      - `InnoDB` supports ACID-compliant transactions, whereas `MyISAM` does not.
      - `InnoDB` supports foreign key constraints, while `MyISAM` does not.
      - `MyISAM` typically offers better read performance, while `InnoDB` offers better write performance.
   - **How can you lock a table explicitly?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
LOCK TABLES table_name READ|WRITE; --Lock for reading/writing
UNLOCK TABLES; --To release the lock

```
- **How do you get the second highest value from a table column?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE column_name < (SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name);

```
- **What is a correlated subquery?**
   - **Answer:** A correlated subquery is a subquery that references columns from the outer query. It's executed once for each row processed by the outer query.
```sql
SELECT column_name 
FROM table_name t1
WHERE some_value = (SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name t2 WHERE t1.id = t2.id);

```
- **How can you increase the performance of a MySQL database?**
   - **Answer:** Optimize queries using `EXPLAIN`, use indexes wisely, normalize database schema, consider hardware upgrades, and configure database parameters appropriately in `my.cnf` or `my.ini`.
- **How do you backup and restore a MySQL database?**
   - **Answer:**
```bash
mysqldump -u username -p database_name > backup.sql

```
To restore:

```bash
mysql -u username -p database_name < backup.sql

```
- **What are the different types of MySQL collations?**
   - **Answer:** Collations specify the rules for string comparison. There are various types like `utf8_general_ci`, `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`, and `latin1_general_ci`.
- **How do you find the total number of rows affected by a query?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
SELECT ROW_COUNT();

```
- **Explain the difference between `CHAR` and `VARCHAR` data types.**
   - **Answer:** `CHAR` has a fixed length, while `VARCHAR` has a variable length. For `CHAR`, unused spaces are filled with blank spaces, whereas `VARCHAR` only uses the required storage plus one or two extra bytes for the length.
- **How can you change the data type of a column in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name NEW_DATA_TYPE;

```
- **How can you measure the size of a MySQL database?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
SELECT table_schema AS "Database", ROUND(SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS "Size (MB)" 
FROM information_schema.TABLES 
GROUP BY table_schema;

```
- **How can you delete all records from a table without deleting the table?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

```
- **How can you prevent a query from displaying duplicate rows?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;

```
- **How can you remove leading and trailing whitespace from a string in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
SELECT TRIM(column_name) FROM table_name;

```
- **Explain the purpose of `information_schema` in MySQL.**
   - **Answer:** `information_schema` is a meta-database that provides detailed information about all other databases, tables, columns, indexes, constraints, etc. present in the MySQL server.
- **How can you ensure that a field value is unique across the table, other than using the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint?**
   - **Answer:** Use the `UNIQUE` constraint on the desired column.
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD UNIQUE (column_name);

```
- **How can you count the total number of tables in a database?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'your_database_name';

```
- **How can you find all the tables that have a specific column name in a database?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE column_name = 'desired_column' AND table_schema = 'your_database_name';

```
- **How can you replace a specific string in a field?**
   - **Answer:**
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column_name = REPLACE(column_name, 'old_string', 'new_string');

```
- **What is the difference between `NOW()` and `CURDATE()` functions in MySQL?**
   - **Answer:** `NOW()` returns the current date and time, while `CURDATE()` returns only the current date.

These questions cover a range of advanced topics and should help in assessing the depth of knowledge of individuals familiar with MySQL.





**89. Explain the `WITH` clause and provide an example.**


- **Answer:** The `WITH` clause, also known as Common Table Expressions (CTE), provides a temporary result set that you can reference within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. It's useful for breaking down complex queries.

```sql
WITH CTE_Name AS (
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
)
SELECT * FROM CTE_Name;

```
**90. What is a self-join and why would you use it?**


- **Answer:** A self-join is a join where a table is joined with itself. It's useful for finding relationships within the same table.

```sql
SELECT A.column_name, B.column_name 
FROM table_name A, table_name B 
WHERE A.column_name = B.column_name;

```
**91. What are the different types of subqueries? Explain with examples.**


- **Answer:** There are three types:
- Scalar subquery: Returns a single value.

```sql
SELECT column_name 
FROM table_name 
WHERE another_column = (SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name);

```

- Row subquery: Returns a single row.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 
FROM table_name 
WHERE (column1, column2) = (SELECT column1, column2 FROM another_table WHERE condition);

```

- Table subquery: Returns a table.

```sql
SELECT column_name 
FROM (
  SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition
) AS subquery_name;

```

**92. How can you update data in one table based on data in another table?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
UPDATE table1
SET table1.column_name = table2.column_name
FROM table2
WHERE table1.another_column = table2.another_column;

```
**93. How can you retrieve a random row from a table?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
SELECT column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1;

```
**94. What's the difference between `INNER JOIN` and `OUTER JOIN`?**


- **Answer:** `INNER JOIN` returns rows when there's a match in both tables. `OUTER JOIN` returns all rows from one table and the matching rows from the other table, filling with NULL if no match is found.

**95. How can you clone a table, including both data and schema?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT * FROM original_table;

```
**96. How do you insert multiple rows in a single SQL query?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) 
VALUES (value1a, value2a), 
       (value1b, value2b), 
       ...;

```
**97. Explain partitions in MySQL. How do you create them?**


- **Answer:** Partitioning divides a table into smaller, more manageable pieces, yet still being treated as a single table. It can improve performance and assist in organizing large datasets.

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
   column_name1 INT,
   column_name2 DATE
)
PARTITION BY RANGE(YEAR(column_name2)) (
   PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1991),
   PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (1995),
   PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (1999)
);

```
**98. What is the `GROUP_CONCAT` function and provide an example.**


- **Answer:** It's used to concatenate values from multiple rows into a single string.

```sql
SELECT group_column, GROUP_CONCAT(value_column)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY group_column;

```
**99. How can you prevent SQL injection in your queries?**


- **Answer:** Using parameterized queries or prepared statements. In PHP, for instance, you'd use PDO or MySQLi to bind parameters.

**100. How do you show the current SQL mode, and how can you change it?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
SELECT @@sql_mode;  -- To show
SET sql_mode = 'modes';  -- To change

```
**101. What is a transaction and how would you use it in MySQL?**


- **Answer:** Transactions group a set of tasks into a single execution unit. If one task fails, all fail. Useful for maintaining data integrity.

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO table_name1 ...;
INSERT INTO table_name2 ...;
COMMIT;  -- Or ROLLBACK;

```
**102. What are the differences between `VARCHAR` and `TEXT` data types?**


- **Answer:** While both are used to store strings, `VARCHAR` can store up to 65,535 characters and you can specify its max length, while `TEXT` can store up to 65,535 characters without specifying max length. `VARCHAR` can have a default value, but `TEXT` cannot.

**103. How do you find and fix broken foreign key constraints?**


- **Answer:** Identify them using a `LEFT JOIN` to find orphaned records, and either delete these records or update them to restore referential integrity.

**104. How do you use `FULLTEXT` indexing in MySQL?**


- **Answer:** `FULLTEXT` indexes are used for full-text searches. You can create one with:

```sql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX index_name ON table_name(column_name);

```
Then you'd search with:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE MATCH(column_name) AGAINST('search term');

```
**105. How can you check for index fragmentation on a table and defragment it?**


- **Answer:** You can check fragmentation using `SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'table_name';` and optimize (defragment) using `OPTIMIZE TABLE table_name;`.

**106. How can you convert character sets in columns?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name COLUMN_TYPE CHARACTER SET charset_name;

```
**107. How do you schedule a recurring SQL script execution in MySQL?**


- **Answer:** Using MySQL's Event Scheduler. First, ensure the scheduler is on with `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'event_scheduler';`, then create your scheduled event.

**108. What are MySQL stored procedures and how do you use them?**


- **Answer:** Stored procedures are SQL codes saved in the database to be reused. Created using `CREATE PROCEDURE`, and called via `CALL procedure_name()`.

**109. How would you monitor the performance of your MySQL database in real-time?**


- **Answer:** Tools like `SHOW PROCESSLIST`, Performance Schema, MySQL Enterprise Monitor, and third-party tools like Percona Monitoring and Management.

**110. How can you run SQL script from the command line without entering the MySQL console?**


- **Answer:** Use:

```bash
mysql -u username -p database_name < script.sql

```
**111. What is the `EXPLAIN` keyword in MySQL?**


- **Answer:** `EXPLAIN` provides a query execution plan, showing how MySQL will execute the query, which can be vital for optimization.

**112. How do you enforce a column to not accept NULL values?**


- **Answer:** By adding the `NOT NULL` constraint during table creation or modification.

**113. How do you rename a database in MySQL?**


- **Answer:** MySQL does not have a straightforward command to rename a database. Instead, one common approach is to dump the database, create a new one with the desired name, and then restore the dumped database into the new one.

**114. How can you reset the auto-increment value of a column?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name AUTO_INCREMENT = value;

```
**115. How can you handle time zones in MySQL?**


- **Answer:** MySQL provides the `CONVERT_TZ()` function to convert datetime values across time zones. Additionally, `SET time_zone = timezone;` sets the time zone for the current session.

**116. How do you retrieve only a specified number of characters from a string column?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
SELECT LEFT(column_name, number_of_chars) FROM table_name;

```
**117. What are views in MySQL and why are they used?**


- **Answer:** Views are virtual tables based on the result set of an SQL statement. They encapsulate the SQL statement and present data in a simplified manner, ensuring data abstraction, protection, and to represent a subset of the data.

**118. How do you find the second highest value in a column?**


- **Answer:**

```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name) 
FROM table_name 
WHERE column_name NOT IN (SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name);

```
These questions should serve well for interviews at product-based companies that expect a deep understanding of MySQL.
